# Certificate Verification System

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
The Certificate Verification System is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows educational institutions and organizations to issue, verify, and revoke certificates on the blockchain. It ensures that certificates are immutable, easily verifiable, and tamper-proof.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To eliminate the prevalence of fake certificates and simplify the process of verifying the authenticity of academic and professional credentials using blockchain technology.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Admin Control**: Only the contract admin can issue or revoke certificates.
- **Immutable Records**: Once issued, certificate data is securely stored on-chain.
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify a certificate using its ID.
- **Revocation**: Admins can revoke certificates if needed.
- **Events**: Emitted when certificates are issued or revoked for auditability.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Role-based access for multiple trusted issuers (e.g., colleges, trainers)
- NFT-based certificates for visual representation
- IPFS integration for certificate documents
- Multi-language verification portal (frontend)
- Integration with job boards and recruitment portals
